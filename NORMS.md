# NORMS

## DISAGREEMENTS

-- find a third party, if not resolved in 5 mins, meet as group

## MERGING

-- two members will take administrative responsibility for merging, one during classtime and one outside of classtime. -- require signoff by the MERGEMASTERS or a delegate. MMs decided during standup

-- attempt a merge on local to see if stuff breaks. If it does, fix it before official submit

## ASKING FOR HELP
